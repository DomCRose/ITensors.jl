## Key features needed

+ AutoMPO

## To Do

+ davidson improvements
  - evaluate logic (cyclic permutation of order of steps in main for loop?)
  - improve definitions and handling of parameters such as miniter, maxiter

+ Improve printing of Sweeps struct

## Design Questions

+ Should we rename methods like storage_svd etc. to just svd?
  Arguments for changing:
    - could use storage objects better in generic algorithms
      (e.g. put a Dense{Float64} object into a Krylov library routine)
    - hard to draw line between which functions are "storage_func" or just "func"
  Arguments for status quo:
    - makes code more readable in some ways
    - easier to see which methods to overload to make a new storage type
      (but we can address this by listing such methods in the docs)
