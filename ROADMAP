## Misc To Do

+ davidson improvements
  - evaluate logic (cyclic permutation of order of steps in main for loop?)
  - improve definitions and handling of parameters such as miniter, maxiter

+ Improve printing of Sweeps

+ MPS/MPO algorithms

+ AutoMPO (Miles)

+ Boson site set

+ QN Index

+ QN block-sparse tensors (with separate block-sparse library as discussed)

## Performance Issues

+ (May 19) DMRG is taking 30-40 seconds for N=100, S=1 Heisenberg chain (C++ is 9 seconds)

## Design Questions

+ Use Reexport.jl to better organize modules and export commands?

+ Should we rename methods like storage_svd etc. to just svd?
  Arguments for changing:
    - could use storage objects better in generic algorithms
      (e.g. put a Dense{Float64} object into a Krylov library routine)
    - hard to draw line between which functions are "storage_func" or just "func"
  Arguments for status quo:
    - makes code more readable in some ways
    - easier to see which methods to overload to make a new storage type
      (but we can address this by listing such methods in the docs)
