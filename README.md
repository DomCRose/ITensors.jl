ITensor is a library for rapidly creating correct and efficient
tensor network algorithms. 

An ITensor is a tensor whose interface 
is independent of its memory layout. ITensor indices are
objects which carry extra information and which
'recognize' each other (compare equal to each other).

The ITensor library also includes many composable algorithms 
for optimizing and transforming tensor networks, such as 
operations on matrix product state and matrix product operators,
and the DMRG algorithm.
