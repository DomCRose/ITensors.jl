ITensor is a library for rapid development of correct and efficient
tensor network algorithms. 

An ITensor is way of representing a tensor such that its interface 
and operations are independent of its memory layout. Each Index of 
an ITensor is itself an object and copies of the same Index
'recognize' each other (compare equal to each other).

In addition to being an efficient tensor library, ITensor provides
composable algorithms for optimizing and transforming tensor networks.
